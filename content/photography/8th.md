Digital Media Seminar
Students in this class will work with digital cameras, video cameras, Photoshop Elements, iPhoto and iMovie to develop multimedia projects.  Class activities will include a Claymation movie, silent movie, digital photography projects, a research project on American photographers, and a field trip with an emphasis on photography.  Being familiar with digital photography and video would be helpful, but not a requirement.  Students in the 2nd semester of this class will produce the 8th grade continuation video.  Students will receive a print of their photos and a DVD of videos produced in class.
