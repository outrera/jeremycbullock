## About the Class

Intro to Digital Photography
Students will learn to take great photos in this class as they explore the different types of photography and learn how to better use cameras.  The class will help students understand the concepts of exposure, composition, and subject choice.  Photo editing will also be covered as students learn to use Photoshop through a variety of creative projects.  Students will also use photography as a gateway to understanding video as they create a stop-motion movie.  Students will receive prints of their photos and a DVD of their stop-motion.
