With the start of a new semester and new year, I am again trying to update the site and make it easier to navigate for students and visitors.

Some new items are:

* Dropdown at the top for each class
* Each class has links at the top, followed by projects and a class overview
* Small tweaks to the content for clarity and ease of use.
* Updated graphics here and there

The big task ahead of me is to incorporate my catalog of video tutorials into the site.  Where applicable I will be adding tutorials to the class projects section for each class but there will be a handful of tutorials that don't necessarily relate to a class project that I think students will still be interested in.  I need to find a place to put those.

It's going to be a good year.
