## About the Class

In this class students will explore various styles of animation and discover the elements that make an animation high quality and successful. We will study Stop Motion animation- used in films such as Coraline and Paranorman, and 2D Animation â€“ used in traditional Disney films and the Simpsons and Family Guy. Each of these styles can be wonderful to use but also provide some unique challenges. I am excited to see their work this semester as they grow as story tellers and animators.
