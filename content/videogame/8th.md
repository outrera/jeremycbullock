## About the Class

Students in video game design will study what it takes to make a good video game.  Students will learn the different elements of video games and the design process using a variety of tools.  Final projects will include a variety of games in both 2D and 3D.  We will use a variety of tools to create our games including industry standard software such as Maya and Unity3D.  This class is designed to be both technically and creatively challenging.  This class is a great fit for students who have a strong interest in using technology as a creative tool.
