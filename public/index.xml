Some new items are:
 Dropdown at the top for each class Each class has links at the top, followed by projects and a class overview Small tweaks to the content for clarity and ease of use. Updated graphics here and there  The big task ahead of me is to incorporate my catalog of video tutorials into the site.</description>
